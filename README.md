Unravel the mysteries of a cursed land in this lost 8-bit rpg epic.
Summoned from blissful oblivion by shadowy manipulators of your
destiny, you set forth across a land in crisis. It seems your
arrival is well timed to conincide with an ominous prophesy: the 
hordes of the underworld have found a new leader and are amassing to 
destroy humanity.

As you journey on your quest, you will observe a full day/night cycle. You can choose to camp at night in the wilderness to rest, eat/drink and replenish your magical reserves.

Sometimes you will have to fight and defend yourself against a variety of menacing fauna and mythical beasts, as you explore the darkened depths beneath the land of Svaltfen. During combat you may choose from various melee and ranged weapons, as well as from over 30 magical spells. The action is presented in old-school, turn based combat that values strategy over a fast reaction time.
